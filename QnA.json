it's maybe one percent the the cost"}, {"answer_550": "of"}, {"question_552": "an expandable system"}, {"answer_552": "so that would just be a million bucks"}, {"question_554": "right or"}, {"answer_554": "yeah the marginal cost of launch we"}, {"question_556": "think can be"}, {"answer_556": "um"}, {"question_558": "it could be potentially under a million"}, {"answer_558": "dollars so is there anybody for over a"}, {"question_560": "hundred tons to orbit 100 more than 15"}, {"answer_560": "you said 50. yes"}, {"question_562": "100 tons"}, {"answer_562": "likely and with refinement

spending most of my"}, {"question_580": "time on is"}, {"answer_580": "uh driving the development of starship"}, {"question_582": "starships so you can go to mars or"}, {"answer_582": "however you want civilization on mars uh"}, {"question_584": "civilization on mars"}, {"answer_584": "so what's first the moon base or"}, {"question_586": "moon vice verse correct i mean it's"}, {"answer_586": "close so we might as well okay"}, {"question_588": "yeah you might as well it's practically"}, {"answer_588": "right there you know excuse me well you"}, {"question_590": "um"}, {"answer_590": "you got a contract with the defense"}, {"question_592": "department to do a lunar lander"}, {"answer_592": "from nasa from nasa um which is being"}, {"question_594": "disputed by jeff bezos"},

haven't i've encouraged um"}, {"answer_626": "him to emphasize uh getting to orbit"}, {"question_628": "yeah"}, {"answer_628": "you talk to him i'm not globally"}, {"question_630": "what is it mine no just uh you know"}, {"answer_630": "tweet at him yeah yeah exactly subtweet"}, {"question_632": "if you will"}, {"answer_632": "so what is up to what you do"}, {"question_634": "so what so what are you going to do with"}, {"answer_634": "the lunar lander and how do you get the"}, {"question_636": "moon base there"}, {"answer_636": "yeah so"}, {"answer_638": "starship is designed"},

moon"}, {"answer_672": "um"}, {"question_674": "so there's a lot of a lot of value i"}, {"answer_674": "think to having uh i think it'd be just"}, {"question_676": "freaking cool i mean come on it's like"}, {"answer_676": "we gotta you know humanity let's you got"}, {"question_678": "to represent here for humanity you know"}, {"answer_678": "just have a base on the moon but i think"},
