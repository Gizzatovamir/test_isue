        "CA: How much?",
        "(Applause)",
        "CA: So possibly, initially done,",
        "it's like on a sort\nof toll road-type basis.",
        "EM: Yeah.",
        "CA: Which, I guess,\nalleviates some traffic",
        "from the surface streets as well.",
        "CA: But people -- seen traditionally,\nit's incredibly expensive to dig,",
        "and that would block this idea.",
        "Well, they're right.",
        "CA: And how could you achieve that?",
        "CA: But a lot of people imagining,\ndreaming about future cities,",
        "they imagine that actually\nthe solution is flying cars, drones, etc.",
        "You go aboveground.",
        "Why isn't that a better solution?",
        "You save all that tunneling cost.",
        "Things like that.",
        "CA: So you've got this vision",
        "of future cities with these rich,\n3D networks of tunnels underneath.",
        "Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?",
        "Could you apply these tunnels\nto use for this Hyperloop idea",
        "you released a few years ago.",
        "CA: But you can picture,\nthen, a Hyperloop in a tunnel",
        "running quite long distances.",
        "CA: Huh.",
        "EM: So, yeah.",
        "CA: And so you could actually picture,",
        "what kind of length tunnel\nis in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?",
        "CA: So you've started\na new company to do this",
        "called The Boring Company.",
        "Very nice. Very funny.",
        "CA: How much of your time is this?",
        "CA: You've called it a hobby.",
        "This is what an Elon Musk\nhobby looks like.",
        "CA: So an even bigger part of your time",
        "is being spent on electrifying\ncars and transport through Tesla.",
        "Is one of the motivations\nfor the tunneling project",
        "the realization that actually,",

        "there may end up being\nmore cars on the roads",
        "on any given hour than there are now?",
        "CA: You started Tesla\nwith the goal of persuading the world",
        "that electrification\nwas the future of cars,",
        "and a few years ago,\npeople were laughing at you.",
        "Now, not so much.",
        "EM: OK.",
        "I don't know. I don't know.",
        "CA: But isn't it true that pretty much\nevery auto manufacturer",

        "So Model 3, it's supposed\nto be coming in July-ish.",
        "CA: Wow.",
        "One of the things\nthat people are so excited about",
        "is the fact that it's got autopilot.",

        "CA: Right. Many other people\nare going the LIDAR route.",
        "You want cameras plus radar is most of it.",
        "CA: So the new cars being sold right now\nhave eight cameras in them.",
        "They can't yet do what that showed.",
        "When will they be able to?",
        "CA: OK, so by the end\nof the year, you're saying,",

        "CA: Amazing.",
        "But part of that is possible",
        "because you've already got a fleet\nof Teslas driving all these roads.",
        "You're accumulating a huge amount\nof data of that national road system.",

        "in terms of the technology alone,",
        "the time when someone\nwill be able to buy one of your cars",
        "and literally just take the hands\noff the wheel and go to sleep",

        "how far away is that, to do that safely?",
        "CA: To sleep.",
        "I guess the big concern of yours\nis that people may actually",
        "get seduced too early\nto think that this is safe,",
        "and that you'll have some horrible\nincident happen that puts things back.",
        "CA: But once you get\nliterally safe hands-off driving,",
        "the power to disrupt\nthe whole industry seems massive,",
        "because at that point you've spoken\nof people being able to buy a car,",
        "drops you off at work,\nand then you let it go",

        "CA: You put them in the ones\nthat are likely to see a lot of sun,",
        "and that makes these roofs\nsuper affordable, right?",
        "They're not that much more expensive\nthan just tiling the roof.",
        "EM: Yeah.",

        "CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?",
        "How many houses do you believe\ncould end up having this type of roofing?",
        "CA: Is there a mental model thing\nthat people don't get here",
        "that because of the shift in the cost,\nthe economics of solar power,",
        "most houses actually have\nenough sunlight on their roof",
        "pretty much to power all of their needs.",
        "If you could capture the power,",
        "it could pretty much\npower all their needs.",
        "You could go off-grid, kind of.",
        "CA: So the key to the economics",
        "of the cars, the Semi, of these houses",
        "is the falling price\nof lithium-ion batteries,",
        "which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.",
        "In many ways, that's almost\nthe core competency.",
        "And you've decided",
        "that to really, like, own that competency,",
        "you just have to build\nthe world's largest manufacturing plant",

        "with this guy. What is this?",
        "It's a small detail.",

        "like a hundred gigawatt hours\nof batteries a year.",
        "CA: And they're actually\nbeing produced right now.",
        "EM: They're in production already.\nCA: You guys put out this video.",
        "I mean, is that speeded up?",
        "CA: How fast does it actually go?",
        "CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,\nabout what makes an exciting future",
        "is a future where we no longer\nfeel guilty about energy.",
        "Help us picture this.",
        "How many Gigafactories, if you like,\ndoes it take to get us there?",
        "CA: See, I find this amazing.",
        "You can picture what it would take",
        "to move the world\noff this vast fossil fuel thing.",
        "It's like you're building one,",
        "it costs five billion dollars,",
        "or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.",
        "Like, it's kind of cool\nthat you can picture that project.",
        "And you're planning to do, at Tesla --\nannounce another two this year.",
        "Yeah, probably four.",
        "CA: Whoa.",

        "Like -- where, continent?",
        "You can say no.",

        "EM: Who?",
        "CA: Who has said he doesn't\nreally believe in climate change,",
        "and there's a lot of people out there\nwho think you shouldn't be doing that.",
        "They'd like you to walk away from that.",

        "you spoke about what seemed like\na kind of incredibly ambitious dream",
        "to develop rockets\nthat were actually reusable.",

        "but now you've done this,\nwhat, five or six times?",
        "CA: And for the first time,",
        "you've actually reflown\none of the rockets that landed.",
        "CA: Right. So this is allowing you\nto dream of this really ambitious idea",
        "of sending many, many, many people to Mars",
        "in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.",
        "EM: Yeah.",

        "people, cargo, everything,",

        "We're trying to dig a hole under LA,",
        "and this is to create the beginning",
        "of what will hopefully\nbe a 3D network of tunnels",
        "to alleviate congestion.",
        "So right now, one of the most\nsoul-destroying things is traffic.",
        "It affects people\nin every part of the world.",
        "It takes away so much of your life.",
        "It's horrible.",
        "It's particularly horrible in LA.",
        "EM: Yeah, absolutely.\nSo this is the first time --",
        "Just to show what we're talking about.",
        "So a couple of key things\nthat are important",
        "in having a 3D tunnel network.",
        "First of all, you have to be able",
        "to integrate the entrance\nand exit of the tunnel",
        "seamlessly into the fabric of the city.",
        "So by having an elevator,",
        "sort of a car skate,\nthat's on an elevator,",
        "you can integrate the entrance\nand exits to the tunnel network",
        "just by using two parking spaces.",
        "And then the car gets on a skate.",
        "There's no speed limit here,",
        "so we're designing this to be able\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour.",
        "EM: 200 kilometers an hour,\nor about 130 miles per hour.",
        "So you should be able\nto get from, say, Westwood to LAX",
        "in six minutes -- five, six minutes.",
        "EM: So, I don't know\nif people noticed it in the video,",
        "but there's no real limit\nto how many levels of tunnel you can have.",
        "You can go much further deep\nthan you can go up.",
        "The deepest mines are much deeper\nthan the tallest buildings are tall,",
        "so you can alleviate any arbitrary\nlevel of urban congestion",
        "with a 3D tunnel network.",
        "This is a very important point.",
        "So a key rebuttal to the tunnels\nis that if you add one layer of tunnels,",
        "that will simply alleviate congestion,\nit will get used up,",
        "and then you'll be back where you started,\nback with congestion.",
        "But you can go to any\narbitrary number of tunnels,",
        "any number of levels.",
        "EM: Yeah.",
        "To give you an example,\nthe LA subway extension,",
        "which is -- I think it's\na two-and-a-half mile extension",
        "that was just completed\nfor two billion dollars.",
        "So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile\nto do the subway extension in LA.",
        "And this is not the highest\nutility subway in the world.",
        "So yeah, it's quite difficult\nto dig tunnels normally.",
        "I think we need to have\nat least a tenfold improvement",
        "in the cost per mile of tunneling.",
        "EM: Actually, if you just do two things,",
        "you can get to approximately\nan order of magnitude improvement,",
        "and I think you can go beyond that.",
        "So the first thing to do\nis to cut the tunnel diameter",
        "by a factor of two or more.",
        "So a single road lane tunnel\naccording to regulations",
        "has to be 26 feet,\nmaybe 28 feet in diameter",
        "to allow for crashes\nand emergency vehicles",
        "and sufficient ventilation\nfor combustion engine cars.",
        "But if you shrink that diameter\nto what we're attempting,",
        "which is 12 feet, which is plenty\nto get an electric skate through,",
        "you drop the diameter by a factor of two",
        "and the cross-sectional area\nby a factor of four,",
        "and the tunneling cost scales\nwith the cross-sectional area.",
        "So that's roughly a half-order\nof magnitude improvement right there.",
        "Then tunneling machines currently tunnel\nfor half the time, then they stop,",
        "and then the rest of the time\nis putting in reinforcements",
        "for the tunnel wall.",
        "So if you design the machine instead",
        "to do continuous\ntunneling and reinforcing,",
        "that will give you\na factor of two improvement.",
        "Combine that and that's a factor of eight.",
        "Also these machines are far from being\nat their power or thermal limits,",
        "so you can jack up the power\nto the machine substantially.",
        "I think you can get\nat least a factor of two,",
        "maybe a factor of four or five\nimprovement on top of that.",
        "So I think there's a fairly\nstraightforward series of steps",
        "to get somewhere in excess\nof an order of magnitude improvement",
        "in the cost per mile,",
        "and our target actually is --",

        "EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system\nis likely to at least mitigate the crash,",
        "except in rare circumstances.",
        "The thing to appreciate\nabout vehicle safety",
        "is this is probabilistic.",
        "I mean, there's some chance that any time\na human driver gets in a car,",

        "you can choose to share it sometimes\nbut not other times.",
        "That's 100 percent what will occur.",

        "we want to show that no, an electric truck",
        "actually can out-torque any diesel semi.",
        "And if you had a tug-of-war competition,",
        "the Tesla Semi\nwill tug the diesel semi uphill.",
        "EM: Yes. So what will be\nreally fun about this",
        "is you have a flat torque RPM curve\nwith an electric motor,",
        "whereas with a diesel motor or any kind\nof internal combustion engine car,",
        "you've got a torque RPM curve\nthat looks like a hill.",
        "So this will be a very spry truck.",
        "You can drive this\naround like a sports car.",
        "There's no gears.\nIt's, like, single speed.",

        "You've got an electric car\nin the driveway.",
        "If you look in between\nthe electric car and the house,",
        "there are actually three Powerwalls\nstacked up against the side of the house,",
        "and then that house roof is a solar roof.",
        "So that's an actual solar glass roof.",
        "EM: That's a picture of a real --\nwell, admittedly, it's a real fake house.",
        "That's a real fake house.",
        "where you can adjust\nthe texture and the color",
        "to a very fine-grained level,",

        "all the tiles look the same",

        "If you were to look at it\nfrom a helicopter,",

        "We're very confident\nthat the cost of the roof",
        "A solar glass roof will be less\nthan the cost of a normal roof",
        "plus the cost of electricity.",
        "So in other words,",
        "this will be economically a no-brainer,",
        "we think it will look great,",
        "and it will last --",
        "We thought about having\nthe warranty be infinity,",

        "EM: Yeah, we're starting off\nwith two, two initially,",

        "almost all houses will have a solar roof.",

        "to be probably on the order",
        "of 40 or 50 years.",
        "So on average, a roof\nis replaced every 20 to 25 years.",
        "But you don't start replacing\nall roofs immediately.",
        "But eventually,\nif you say were to fast-forward",
        "to say 15 years from now,",
        "it will be unusual to have a roof\nthat does not have solar.",
        "EM: It depends on where you are",
        "and what the house size is\nrelative to the roof area,",
        "but it's a fair statement to say",
        "that most houses in the US\nhave enough roof area",
        "to power all the needs of the house.",
        "EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,",
        "progress so far on the Gigafactory.",
        "Eventually, you can sort of roughly see",
        "that there's sort of\na diamond shape overall,",
        "and when it's fully done,\nit'll look like a giant diamond,",
        "or that's the idea behind it,",
        "and it's aligned on true north.",
        "EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.\nWe think probably more, but yeah.",
        "EM: That's the slowed down version.",
        "EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,",
        "you can't actually see the cells\nwithout a strobe light.",
        "It's just blur.",
        "EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.",
        "It's not 10, it's not a thousand.",
        "Most likely a hundred.",
        "EM: I think we'll announce locations",
        "for somewhere between two\nand four Gigafactories later this year.",
        "EM: We need to address a global market.",
        "EM: Well, I think that first of all,",
        "I'm just on two advisory councils",
        "where the format consists\nof going around the room",
        "and asking people's opinion on things,",
        "and so there's like a meeting\nevery month or two.",
        "That's the sum total of my contribution.",
        "But I think to the degree\nthat there are people in the room",
        "who are arguing in favor\nof doing something about climate change,",

        "(Applause)",
        "And if I hadn't done that,",
        "that wasn't on the agenda before.",
        "So maybe nothing will happen,\nbut at least the words were said.",
        "EM: Finally. It took a long time.",
        "EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters",
        "coming back from\nvery high and fast in space.",
        "So just delivered the upper stage",
        "at high velocity.",
        "I think this might have been\nat sort of Mach 7 or so,",
        "EM: That was the slowed down version.",
        "EM: We're at eight or nine.",
        "EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster",
        "and then prepped it for flight again\nand flew it again,",
        "so it's the first reflight\nof an orbital booster",
        "where that reflight is relevant.",
        "So it's important to appreciate\nthat reusability is only relevant",
        "if it is rapid and complete.",
        "So like an aircraft or a car,",

        "You do not send your aircraft\nto Boeing in-between flights.",
        "EM: Well, visually\nyou can see that's a person.",
        "The thrust level of this is really --",
        "This configuration is about four times\nthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.",
        "In units of 747, a 747 is only about\na quarter of a million pounds of thrust,",
        "so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,",
        "there's 40 747s.",
        "So this would be the thrust equivalent\nof 120 747s, with all engines blazing.",

        "maximum passengers,\nmaximum cargo on the 747 --",
        "this can take it as cargo.",
        "EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of\nan eight- to 10-year time frame.",
        "Aspirationally, that's our target.",
        "Our internal targets\nare more aggressive, but I think --",
        "EM: While vehicle seems quite large",
        "and is large by comparison\nwith other rockets,",

        "It's like a branching\nstream of probabilities,",

        "um",
        "uh well it it would appear that they",
        "don't love cryptocurrency appear it",
        "appears yeah",
        "yeah it's subtle but",
        "yeah you're hinting in that direction",
        "um",
        "yeah so um",
        "i can't speak to exactly why they don't",
        "like it that much but people can",
        "speculate for various reasons",
        "um",
        "china by the way it has is having some",
        "significant uh electricity generation",
        "issues yeah so",
        "actually i think part of it may actually",
        "be due to",
        "uh",
        "electricity shortages in many parts of",
        "china so",
        "a lot of south south training right now",
        "is having",
        "random",
        "power outages uh because the power",
        "demand is higher than expected",
        "um so",
        "yeah crypto mining might be playing a",
        "role in that i'm not sure um this is",
        "further than that yes wasn't that um",
        "well i suppose uh",
        "cryptocurrency is fundamentally aimed at",
        "um",
        "reducing the power of a centralized",
        "government yes it is and that they they",
        "don't like that",
        "think's going to happen",
        "i mean maybe the audience has obviously",
        "if it goes up i suppose",
        "it is",
        "um",
        "but uh i mean",
        "i think there's",
        "an always long-term role for",
        "for crypto um",
        "and um you know",
        "really people should think of",
        "any kind of",
        "uh money system",
        "whether it's historic value or currency",
        "as as really a form of information if",
        "you apply information theory to",
        "money whether it's cryptocurrency or",
        "some other form",
        "and view it in terms of you know how",
        "good is it at um",
        "you know sort of bandwidth latency uh",
        "jitter uh dropping packets uh which is",
        "you'd say like fraud is like losing",
        "packets or something on the network um",
        "and um",
        "you know it's overall security uh",
        "then",
        "i think a lot of these things just seem",
        "to just make make a lot of sense in that",
        "regard like",
        "any form of money has no power in and of",
        "itself except as an exchange of",
        "uh value between people for goods or",
        "services or to",
        "translate uh",
        "i it is not possible to",
        "i think",
        "destroy",
        "crypto but it is possible for",
        "governments to",
        "anything",
        "yeah i mean",
        "i wouldn't seriously just let it play",
        "um",
        "well what what do you think governments",
        "yeah i mean i i i'm i wouldn't say that",
        "i'm some you know",
        "massive cryptocurrency expert um",
        "you know i think the",
        "there's some value in cryptocurrency i",
        "don't think it's like the sep the second",
        "coming of the messiah which some people",
        "think um",
        "you know",
        "it's uh",
        "it it will hopefully reduce the",
        "uh",
        "error and latency",
        "in",
        "the money system the legacy money",
        "systems and reduce the yeah i mean just",
        "you know uh governments have a habit of",
        "um editing the money database um which",
        "is like probably some ancient mainframe",
        "somewhere in virginia rancoball",
        "if i",
        "it's kind of bleak to think about that",
        "um",
        "but uh so you know when governments",
        "can't",
        "keep their hand out of the cookie jar",
        "and edit the money database there's",
        "probably some value to that",
        "yeah",
        "that's going to be oh no",
        "um well i mean i mostly don't tweet",
        "about crypto this is a minority of small",
        "number of tweets okay so",
        "um",
        "i do know a lot about",
        "the money system and payments and how it",
        "actually works as opposed to say how",
        "economists think it works",
        "um",
        "on a practical basis just how money",
        "money is just",
        "basically the monetary system is a",
        "series of heterogeneous databases uh",
        "that uh are not real time with the",
        "exception of paypal and a few others um",
        "and engage and to reconcile on a batch",
        "basis",
        "uh",
        "you know that that may take anywhere",
        "from 24 hours to",
        "several days",
        "um",
        "and um so just it's slow that's just a",
        "lot of latency in jitter and uh",
        "the",
        "ach system is has basically no security",
        "um so and this has just been in the it",
        "was that way when paypal started",
        "in 99 and it's uh still that way 22",
        "years later it needs reform yeah yeah",
        "um",
        "well hmm",
        "guessing i well",
        "maybe um",
        "i don't know i think there's there are",
        "there are some",
        "uh changes afoot in china um",
        "i think part of this may be",
        "uh actually covert related in the sense",
        "that um",
        "it's been quite difficult to have",
        "in-person meetings in china and trying",
        "to really runs",
        "the whole system is set up to run on the",
        "basis of in-person meetings and the",
        "absence of",
        "of these meetings for the past 18 months",
        "i think has",
        "probably led to",
        "things being worse than",
        "they would be if there were more",
        "in-person meetings",
        "so i think as covert lifts and the",
        "in-person meetings return i think",
        "the uh",
        "the i think probably there will be an",
        "increase in the in the sort of trust",
        "level and i think things will probably",
        "start heading in a more positive",
        "and the government yeah both internally",
        "within china and uh with respect to",
        "uh people from the us and other",
        "countries going and visiting and meeting",
        "with officials in the chinese government",
        "now it's just it china is very much set",
        "up to",
        "work with the in-person meetings and so",
        "covert",
        "i think has impeded that um",
        "so i think",
        "i think things will improve",
        "most likely as the in-person meetings",
        "um i think",
        "not all of it can be described to that",
        "but it's uh",
        "some of it can be um",
        "yeah um well we'll see i i i suspect",
        "things will",
        "improve next year because of just better",
        "yeah um we've got a big factory in",
        "shanghai which is doing very well at",
        "tesla trying to tell the tesla china",
        "team is uh doing great work",
        "and",
        "we we do well with selling in the",
        "chinese park as well as producing cars",
        "for china and for export to europe",
        "um",
        "so",
        "overall things are going pretty well",
        "i relations",
        "it's not",
        "uh no i've not set myself up um i",
        "suppose i will at some point",
        "but my goal is not to set myself up my",
        "goal is to",
        "open up space for humanity and",
        "ultimately",
        "set us on a path becoming a space spring",
        "civilization and a multi-planet species",
        "it's near the hero there i will go at",
        "so ball sub orbital is a step in the",
        "direction of orbit but",
        "so",
        "but just to put things in perspective",
        "you need about 100 times more energy to",
        "get to",
        "orbit",
        "versus sub orbit",
        "um and then to get back from morbid you",
        "need to burn off that energy so you need",
        "a",
        "like heavy-duty heat shield because",
        "you're coming in like a meteor yes so",
        "so like",
        "orbit is roughly towards magnitude more",
        "difficult than than subwood",
        "but it's still you know good to do",
        "that",
        "um i thought it was cool that they're",
        "um",
        "spending money on the advancement of",
        "space i think we ultimately want to be",
        "humanity wants to be",
        "should want to be a space-bearing",
        "civilization and out there among the",
        "stars and we want i think we",
        "really want",
        "you know",
        "i mean",
        "all these things that we see in science",
        "fiction movies and books like you know",
        "we want those to be like",
        "real one day not always fiction right so",
        "i think it's good that",
        "people are spending their money",
        "it's always sound like to a computer",
        "all these efforts",
        "yeah so with respect to spacex um",
        "let's see",
        "um",
        "i mean there's two",
        "besides uh overlooking space flight and",
        "uh providing transport for",
        "nasa of astronauts and cargo to and from",
        "the space station which we've been doing",
        "for a while now over a decade",
        "we are",
        "we have something called starlink which",
        "is a global internet system",
        "um and this is i think gonna have some",
        "profound positive effects on the world",
        "because this star link is really",
        "designed to serve the the least served",
        "fifteen hundred and you wanna put 30 000",
        "yeah so",
        "in order to provide high bandwidth low",
        "latency connectivity to a large number",
        "of people",
        "you need a lot of satellites",
        "and they need to be",
        "at low earth orbit so that latency is is",
        "low",
        "the problem with",
        "satellites that are at geostationary",
        "orbit is that they are uh you know",
        "around 36 000 kilometers whereas we are",
        "at 550 kilometers",
        "so gigantic difference in latency",
        "um",
        "for the starting system you could play",
        "like a competitive",
        "video game um that's latency dependent",
        "and still be able to play it with",
        "starlight",
        "um it's like browsing a terrestrial",
        "system essentially",
        "um",
        "and",
        "but starlink is really um",
        "just to be clear not a threat to",
        "5g or",
        "terrestrial fiber or anything like that",
        "it's",
        "but it's very well suited to",
        "low to medium density",
        "regions of the earth",
        "places that where it is too expensive to",
        "trench fiber or put",
        "cells you know 5g",
        "cellular base stations",
        "and so",
        "it's really a good it kind of",
        "takes care of the the people that that",
        "just didn't get",
        "internet either it's too slow or too",
        "expensive or they just don't have it at",
        "all it's very well suited a space-based",
        "system for serving like the least served",
        "maybe five percent or something like",
        "i mean i think it's quite significant",
        "in that the",
        "launch side of things just just",
        "launching other people's satellites and",
        "serving the space station",
        "uh probably tops out around you know",
        "three or four million dollars a year of",
        "revenue whereas",
        "if we can get to say three percent of",
        "global",
        "internet traffic then that that's and",
        "that's roughly a trillion dollar a year",
        "business then we can increase our",
        "revenue by order of magnitude more like",
        "the 30 billion or something like that",
        "um",
        "and",
        "and then we can use the proceeds from",
        "that to",
        "develop the rocket technology necessary",
        "to get humanity to",
        "mars and to the moon and else elsewhere",
        "in the solar system",
        "that that's so then the",
        "you know so so i think sonic is is good",
        "in and of itself uh for providing",
        "uh",
        "like i said providing internet access to",
        "the",
        "the least served in the world it's a",
        "fundamentally good thing in that respect",
        "um",
        "and also offering a little bit of",
        "competition in the cities although the",
        "you know stanley can really maybe uh",
        "serve",
        "less than five percent of people in a",
        "city it's just because of the way the",
        "the the spark beams from space are very",
        "big so",
        "um anyways it's a very nice compliment",
        "um and a necessary complement to",
        "uh",
        "5g and uh",
        "fiber",
        "so",
        "and likes it will provide a revenue",
        "stream for us to develop",
        "our next generation rocket which is a",
        "starship um with starship that we're",
        "trying to achieve the",
        "a fundamental breakthrough that is",
        "the holy grail of rocketry uh that is to",
        "have a fully reusable",
        "oval rocket",
        "um",
        "this is this is extremely fundamental um",
        "with falcon 9 we have a mostly reusable",
        "correct uh we've been landing for quite",
        "a while now but",
        "so we in fact a number of our boosters",
        "are on their 10th uh reflight",
        "so",
        "we've shown that",
        "reusing the",
        "the",
        "boost stage",
        "is can be done and that it is",
        "economically uh",
        "price",
        "between our falcon 9 and competitors",
        "um using a reusable rocket oh yeah sure",
        "um so",
        "uh it's it's really gigantic um",
        "uh without with falcon 9 we still have",
        "to",
        "uh",
        "lose the upper stage and you can think",
        "of each stage being like the equivalent",
        "of a jet airplane so the boost age is",
        "like the big jet airplane upper stage is",
        "the small jet airplane",
        "we still throw away the small generator",
        "plane every time",
        "so",
        "falcon 9 is able to be the most",
        "competitive rocket in the world because",
        "we recover the blue stage in the fairing",
        "but that but still our best case",
        "marginal cost of launch not taking into",
        "account uh",
        "overhead allocation is about 15 million",
        "dollars per launch yeah for 15 tons to",
        "orbit",
        "that's which is quite big like",
        "a spacex um",
        "over the last year or so has",
        "uh delivered about i think roughly",
        "two-thirds of all",
        "payload to orbit of earth",
        "and most of the remaining third is china",
        "and then everyone else is",
        "kind of",
        "they're in the miscellaneous um",
        "so",
        "um",
        "so anyway so but we still have a it's",
        "still 15 million dollars because of the",
        "yeah so",
        "um",
        "basically falcon 9 is effectively about",
        "half to a third the cost of alternatives",
        "um because of the reuse of the boost age",
        "with",
        "uh starship",
        "uh we should be able to get to the point",
        "where",
        "uh it's maybe one percent the the cost",
        "of",
        "right or",
        "yeah the marginal cost of launch we",
        "think can be",
        "um",
        "it could be potentially under a million",
        "hundred tons to orbit 100 more than 15",
        "you said 50. yes",
        "100 tons",
        "likely and with refinement of the design",
        "probably 150 tons so essentially it's it",
        "would be",
        "um you know uh",
        "10 times the payload of falcon 9 uh for",
        "um 15 times lower cost what's that",
        "happening",
        "100 pole better you know it's really",
        "profound um",
        "essentially with starship it is possible",
        "uh to make the economics close for",
        "creating a self-sustaining city on mars",
        "um and a base on the moon for those who",
        "want to go there um",
        "and uh so it's really",
        "very very profound development um",
        "and that's what i'm spending most of my",
        "time on is",
        "uh driving the development of starship",
        "civilization on mars",
        "moon vice verse correct i mean it's",
        "close so we might as well okay",
        "yeah you might as well it's practically",
        "yes how do you feel about that",
        "well i think i've uh expressed my",
        "thoughts on that front um",
        "you know",
        "uh",
        "if i i think you should put more",
        "of his energy into",
        "getting to orbit",
        "than lawsuits",
        "um you can't you cannot see your way to",
        "the moon okay",
        "i mean i think it does have a",
        "i mean it could be",
        "a different shape potentially",
        "you know",
        "well um if you are only going",
        "to doing suborbital then your rocket can",
        "be sort of",
        "shorter yes",
        "get bigger or what",
        "i mean i haven't i've encouraged um",
        "him to emphasize uh getting to orbit",
        "yeah",
        "you talk to him i'm not globally",
        "what is it mine no just uh you know",
        "yeah so",
        "starship is designed",

        "transport system to anywhere in the",
        "solar system",
        "because it is a propulsive lander",
        "and with a propulsive lander",
        "you can land anywhere that's got a solid",
        "surface",
        "so",
        "and it's also designed for",
        "orbital refilling so you can",
        "get the",
        "starship to orbit and then",
        "send tanker flights to refill it so that",
        "it has",
        "a tremendous",
        "delta velocity basically it can go very",
        "far from earth orbit because you can",
        "well i think that the moon base i mean",
        "certainly there's like a lot we could",
        "learn scientifically if we had a proper",
        "laboratory on the moon",
        "um",
        "about the nature of the universe and",
        "you know where we all came from and the",
        "early history of earth and that kind of",
        "thing yeah we have a",
        "science station in antarctica and we're",
        "still learning a lot from uh you know",
        "our activities in antarctica and i think",
        "we could learn uh even more on the moon",
        "um",
        "so there's a lot of a lot of value i",
        "think to having uh i think it'd be just",
        "freaking cool i mean come on it's like",
        "we gotta you know humanity let's you got",
        "to represent here for humanity you know",
        "just have a base on the moon but i think",
        "it would be like the hell yeah we got a",
        "base on the moon that's cool yeah you",
        "know um",
        "for tourism what do you think was the",
        "science science uh science uh i think",
        "like the",
        "a lot of a lot can be learned if you've",
        "got a sort of a science station on the",
        "moon like we've got a science station in",
        "antarctica and many other places",
        "um and uh",
        "i think",
        "uh",
        "there's i think there is value um that",
        "shouldn't be denigrated for people who",

        "uh going to orbit or going to the moon",

        "with them you know when",
        "and when",
        "in the apollo program when they landed",
        "on the moon um yeah it was just a",

        "is uh humanity's greatest achievement of",
        "the maybe ever",
        "it's like landing on the moon",
        "you know and that's",
        "inspiring i think to",
        "i think",
        "i think it's got a bit more gravitas",
        "than um",
        "you know metaphorically",

        "gravitas than uh",
        "irritably tourism um it's not like going",
        "to disneyland you know it's like",
        "uh it's more profound than that",
        "so sometimes people use tourism in a",
        "sort of a negative way but",
        "um i think you know especially with the",
        "inspiration flight i think they they",
        "really",
        "i mean they",
        "you know they filmed the whole thing in",
        "real time um",
        "you know they shared their experiences",
        "with the world there's a really cool",
        "group of people",
        "i recommend watching the netflix",
        "show countdown mark penny i've talked",
        "about it it's awesome um i",
        "i didn't have anything to do with it",

        "the production value on the netflix",
        "countdown documentary is amazing um and",
        "you learn about the back story of the",
        "people and",
        "um it's uh",
        "yeah i think uh what tourism um",
        "i think that there's an element of",
        "tourism to it but i think you know it",
        "there's also",
        "uh",
        "you know the technology is expensive at",
        "first um you you can't just when you try",
        "to develop brand new technology it",
        "doesn't instantly become uh cheap and",
        "affordable and think of like cell phones",
        "and the early cell phones were",
        "were really expensive and sucked you",
        "know yeah frankly like you know usually",
        "like wall street one where you know he's",
        "walking down the beach with the shoebox",
        "size cell phone on it you know talking",
        "to this",
        "and and so just like really expensive",
        "and",
        "the tech wasn't that great but but if if",
        "some number of people didn't pay for the",
        "expensive cell phones they would not be",
        "the inexpensive cell phones that",
        "um",
        "i mean you know it doesn't have to be",
        "top of your thank you list but i mean",
        "it's not um",
        "yeah i'm just saying that there's a nest",
        "when there's new technology",
        "uh it is necessarily expensive until",
        "uh you can refine the design and you can",
        "scale things up um and then you can make",
        "it more affordable um there is a common",
        "misconception that there's some with",
        "some new technology especially if it's a",
        "physical object that you can just",
        "suddenly make it cheap and available um",
        "and and um",
        "but you have to have many designed",
        "iterations and you've got to scale up",
        "the production and get economies of",
        "scale",
        "like we had this argument um against",
        "tesla for for a long time because people",
        "would say like well why are you building",
        "this tesla roadster back in the day it's",
        "it's basically",
        "a you know",
        "it's an expensive",
        "toy sports car foolish people we're like",
        "yes it is um but um",
        "there's no way we could build an",
        "affordable electric car as of this car",
        "uh any",
        "you know we just didn't have the capital",
        "we didn't have the experience and we",
        "needed to go through several technology",
        "iterations in order to get to something",
        "like the model 3. right",
        "and",
        "i actually wrote a blog about this",
        "because i knew people would be like why",
        "are you making sports class ritual rich",
        "people as though we thought there was",
        "somehow a shortage of",
        "sports cars for rich people or",
        "obviously not um",
        "but better you just gotta you gotta",
        "figure out the technology uh you gotta",
        "go through multiple design like how do",
        "you make something mass market and",
        "affordable",
        "many many design iterations many many",
        "different versions of the technology",
        "a lot of hard work and then you've got",
        "to scale up the production rate so you",
        "get economies of scale and those two",
        "things are what make any given",
        "technology available to the public and",
        "basically every uh technology that we",
        "take for granted today has gone through",
        "will be affordable someday yes",
        "absolutely it has to be in order for it",
        "um in order for moz to be a",
        "self-sustaining civilization it has to",
        "be affordable you say that enough people",
        "you know i i think it's really um",
        "you know if you sort of",
        "look you know",
        "uh just sort of stand back um",
        "just if you just if we just step away",
        "from our sort of antenna seeing",
        "squabbles and say let's look at the big",
        "picture here",
        "what what set of actions can we take",
        "that maximize the probability that the",
        "future is going to be good for",
        "civilization and for consciousness and i",
        "think we should regard consciousness on",
        "earth as",
        "delicate not",
        "uh",
        "you know just",
        "fragile um",
        "and",
        "you know what sort of actions can we do",
        "to",
        "ensure that it continues and that the",
        "scope and scale of consciousness uh",
        "expands",
        "and um",
        "and i'm i'm in favor of of expansion",
        "because like",
        "you know",
        "if we want to understand",
        "what the universe is about and and",
        "what's the meaning of life and",
        "we need to get out there and find out um",
        "and the more we expand the scope and",
        "scale of consciousness the better we",
        "will be able to understand what",
        "questions to ask about the answer that",
        "well first of all with respect to the",
        "astronomers um we are in uh",
        "constant dialogue with the leading",
        "astronomers of the world",
        "and taking great pains to ensure that",
        "our satellites do not interfere with",
        "their telescopes",
        "and we've um",
        "i believe at this point they are",
        "satisfied that they will not um",
        "so",
        "uh yeah we would like to retake great",
        "pains to ensure that uh the satellites",
        "do not reflect or you know uh otherwise",
        "interfere with the",
        "the telescopes including the most",
        "sensitive telescopes so",
        "um",
        "you know there may be a few sort of",
        "amateur astronomers who aren't happy but",
        "the professional ones are",
        "are satisfied that we're taking",
        "reasonable steps to",
        "ensure that we are not standing in the",
        "way of science nor would we ever want to",
        "and we're also looking at uh launching",
        "some uh",
        "new telescopes using starship because",
        "starship is a much bigger vehicle we can",
        "launch satellites that have",
        "uh ten times the resolution of the",
        "hubble which would be great for science",
        "and",
        "in fact we were there's an exciting",
        "program",
        "uh",
        "working with seoul",
        "pearl motor at berkeley on",
        "a big new space satellite um as a space",
        "telescope i should say",
        "um and i think we'll do we'll do more of",
        "those so i think at the end of the day",
        "uh starship and spacex are gonna",
        "do a lot to advance uh our understanding",
        "of",
        "well that would be spectacular yes but",
        "you wouldn't get to enjoy it much of you",
        "narrative for the rest",
        "yeah no i was just asked uh",
        "do you want to die in and i was like",
        "well i suppose if you're going to pick",
        "earth or mars i'm like it'd be cool to",
        "like be",
        "born on earth and down moss i'm not i'm",
        "not like trying to make a beeline to",
        "mars and just you know",
        "dive or something um",
        "it's just that uh yeah i gotta pick one",
        "you're gonna die somewhere",
        "sure mars",
        "short definitely not a couple not too",
        "much a couple hundred yeah you know you",
        "just need",
        "um first of all",
        "half the time you're shielded by this of",
        "by mars itself um that's half the",
        "radiation is just the planet shielding",
        "you and then um",
        "you you want to make maybe have like",
        "i don't know",
        "three feet of dirt ish on the roof or",
        "just kind of a thick roof um they'll be",
        "uh no i think we might uh become taller",
        "actually almost a little bit a little",
        "bit taller yeah because the gravity is",
        "roughly 40 out of both okay that would",
        "when you think about um",
        "i think i do think that's like an",
        "important thing which before if you",
        "think of the various great filters um a",
        "few people are familiar with the sort of",
        "great great filter i thought um you know",
        "one of the filters is do we become a",
        "space for a multi-planet species or not",
        "um so",
        "that is at least one of the one of the",
        "great filters",
        "and we would i think it would be great",
        "to uh pass that um",
        "and have",
        "um be a multi-planet species where the",
        "the critical threshold is",
        "uh",
        "it",
        "on for a mars city if if the resupply",
        "ships from earth stop coming for for any",
        "reason whether that is",
        "civilization on earth uh it could be a",
        "mundane reason or could be world war iii",
        "but",
        "does mars",
        "prosper or die out",
        "and if mars is missing anything at all",
        "like the civilizational equivalent of",
        "vitamin c then it will eventually die",
        "out so you need to get to the point",
        "where",
        "a mars city is self-sustaining even if",
        "the the ships from earth stop coming",
        "then you have passed the great filter or",
        "at least that particular great culture i",
        "think we should",
        "uh endeavor to",
        "uh pass that great filter",
        "as soon as possible",
        "yeah i mean i think we should really try",
        "hard to make it happen in the century um",
        "before the end of the century",
        "not on mars",
        "well i mean i'll you know pop over there",
        "dollars there right well right now we're",
        "not getting anything because we're",
        "i mean most of our launches are",
        "yeah i mean it's it's an important part",
        "of",
        "it's an important part of the business i",
        "mean just just i mean bear in mind if",
        "like if you're in any industry like",
        "let's say you're a pencil manufacturer",
        "okay about 40 of your pencils are going",
        "to go to the government",
        "the government's about 40 of the economy",
        "you know if you're a shoe manufacturer",
        "about 40 of your business is going to be",
        "with the government so",
        "you know it's to be expected that any",
        "any company is going to have uh",
        "uh most companies are going to have a",
        "percentage of business with the",
        "government state federal and local that",
        "is proportionate to the gdp uh of the",
        "trade-off",
        "uh well i mean there was a bunch of very",
        "misleading stuff that was published uh",
        "by pro-publica",
        "um and really that was some",
        "sort of",
        "trickery and",
        "really that they did themselves no good",
        "service by",
        "by doing that um",
        "so first of all with respect to the",
        "government contracts that uh spacex wins",
        "uh",
        "our aspiration is to do the most for the",
        "least and if you look at all the",
        "contracts we've won um we've won them",
        "because we're the best price we have a",
        "better service at a lower price they",
        "weren't just handed to us i don't think",
        "great absolutely i mean",
        "in the",
        "for the lunarland just taking that as",
        "one example",
        "um",
        "our bed was half the price of the blue",
        "origin",
        "lockheed",
        "bed half so",
        "for a vehicle that does basically 10",
        "times more or",
        "eight times more baths",
        "our price was half",
        "and nasa has a mandate to get back to",
        "the moon so",
        "we save taxpayers like three billion",
        "dollars relative to that contract",
        "so i think that's that's a good thing",
        "with respect to my personal taxes um",
        "the um i don't actually draw a salary or",
        "anything my cash compensation is",
        "basically zero um which is a good thing",
        "think yeah yeah um so",
        "um",
        "i do have sock options um that best and",
        "so in the years that the but but i don't",
        "i basically with um",
        "tesla spacex i just um have not really",
        "bothered to sort of take money off the",
        "table which is a common most people do",
        "they sell some of their stock and they",
        "take money off the table",
        "um and for me i just like said i you",
        "know my mind will be that sort of",
        "it was it was the first in and it'll be",
        "the last out um",
        "and um",
        "the success of spacex and tesla was far",
        "from assured and there are many times",
        "when it looked like the companies would",
        "and they did they skirted bankruptcy",
        "many times but i never tried to take",
        "money off the table and now this has",
        "been trying to be turned around and made",
        "into a bad thing and i this is that's",
        "messed up",
        "um",
        "so um but when my stock options uh",
        "um",
        "just before my stock options expire then",
        "i am forced to exercise and my top",
        "marginal tax rate is 53 percent",
        "so i don't think that's particularly low",
        "and it's going to go up next year it's",
        "like probably 57 or something and you",
        "sell",
        "yes and and uh",
        "i um i have a bunch of options that are",
        "expiring uh early next year so i'm",
        "uh",
        "that a huge block of options will sell",
        "in q4 because i have to they'll expire",
        "and my top marginal tax rate uh is 53",
        "percent so you'll eventually pay a lot",
        "of taxes massive yeah i mean basically",
        "majority of",
        "their stock",
        "uh yes they were they were saying that",
        "like somehow borrowing is a trick to get",
        "away from paying taxes but um it's more",
        "important to bear in mind that we've had",
        "a very long expansion",
        "in the economy maybe the longest ever",
        "and borrowing against stock is all",
        "sort of fun and games until you have a",
        "recession and you get the margin calls",
        "and then you go to zero",
        "which is which happens basically every",
        "time there's a recession",
        "um",
        "stocks don't always go up",
        "they go down yours seems to",
        "most stocks have gone up including some",
        "questionable stocks frankly",
        "it's gone up and uh",
        "i mean i have literally gone on record",
        "and said i think bus stop price is too",
        "high in my opinion and this did nothing",
        "to stop the rise of the stock race",
        "so",
        "i don't know what am i supposed to do",
        "you know",
        "i'm i'm not the one making it go up um",
        "so",
        "um",
        "but i think it's important to bring my",
        "like like my actual tax rate is 53 they",
        "try to make it sound",
        "like basically there's a big increase in",
        "the value of the tesla stock and then",
        "they added up",
        "they're just very selectively poked the",

        "taxes are very high they're like over",
        "um when you pay them when you open yes",
        "and a huge amount will be paid",
        "in next three months because of",
        "expiring",
        "options and there was like one year",
        "where i think my taxes were basically",
        "zero and the reason for that was because",
        "i had overpaid taxes the year before",
        "they forgot to mention that",
        "i'm gonna call them back they have no",
        "yeah i think i said some people",
        "some people",
        "use their hair to express themselves i",
        "it for hours",
        "and i consult with my strategy team",
        "yeah",

        "sort of centrist",
        "president then i think uh that would",

        "you know executive",
        "you know not too far left not too far",
        "right",
        "and",
        "and everyone would be like i think",
        "most people would prefer that uh you",
        "know some",
        "when it comes down the election you've",
        "got two choices you're like you know",
        "maybe you don't love either choice but",

        "i hope so",
        "i hope so",

        "um",
        "you've got a rocket um anyway i i i i i",

        "you know",
        "i think a lot of people think that",
        "there's too many people on the planet",
        "but i think there's in fact too few and",
        "the the",

        "you know pearl paul ilik's book",
        "population bomb and it's like uh that",
        "was a long time ago that is not the case",
        "today",
        "um and the there's a there was a massive",
        "notch uh in demographics last year",
        "because uh the birth rate plummeted and",
        "also this year",
        "so",
        "i mean",
        "if you know no no babies no humanity",
        "and",
        "i think generally",
        "uh people should be open to psych",
        "psychedelics yeah",
        "so",
        "yeah clearly",
        "i mean",
        "you know yeah",
        "a lot of people",
        "making laws are kind of from a different",
        "era um",
        "so i think as",
        "you know as as the new generation gets",
        "into political power i think we will see",
        "a greater receptivity to the benefits of",
        "psychedelics",
        "i mean humanities tendencies i mean we",
        "are at a very peaceful moment in history",
        "um",
        "so",
        "you got to separate the",
        "sort of news headlines from the reality",
        "um i think like stephen pinker hobbit",
        "has really pointed this out like we're",
        "actually at the",
        "lowest violence per capita in his in",
        "human history",
        "um it may not seem like that but",
        "objectively those are the statistics",
        "um",
        "let's not say there's no violence or",
        "there aren't things to be improved but",
        "it's",
        "you know it's actually quite good and uh",
        "so",
        "um",
        "but uh you know just like i said in the",
        "big picture wise we i think we want to",
        "take the set of actions that maximize",
        "the probability of the future is good",
        "and",
        "that",
        "civilization continues",
        "and that the",
        "sort of this",
        "small candle of consciousness in the",
        "void that is humanity",
        "continues and there's not",
        "it's not the candle does not go out",
        "well our primary goal is is to",
        "create the technology necessary to get",
        "people to mars in the absence of which",
        "not you know",
        "it's somewhat academic um",
        "so we don't want to get too distracted",
        "from our primary mission of we we've got",
        "to make it at least possible to get it",
        "to go to mars um and we want to",
        "do so as soon as possible um and make",
        "access to mars as widely available as",
        "possible as affordable as possible so",
        "that if somebody wants to go they can",
        "so",
        "that's that's our primary mission um i",
        "mean there are many good causes in the",
        "world but we got to be careful that we",
        "do not try to",
        "um",
        "take on too many uh",
        "i mean there are many noble missions but",
        "we",
        "we have to pick our battles and say okay",
        "let's just make sure we get this done",
        "um",
        "and uh",
        "because nobody else is doing it and i",
        "mean if",
        "spacex doesn't do it i'm not sure",
        "how how it will happen i think this this",
        "is the at least right now spacex is uh",
        "the only hope so we",
        "we gotta get this done and it's far from",
        "done i mean it's",
        "got a lot long way to go",
        "um yeah",
        "i i installing in terms of providing",
        "internet internet connectivity to uh",
        "people that really don't have it or it's",
        "very expensive i think will be",
        "helpful in um",
        "empowering a lot of people who are",
        "disempowered today",
        "so i think that's a good thing too",
        "call him techno king yeah okay that's my",
        "formal title i've found that with yes",
        "and secondly",
        "i can either confirm nor deny",
        "i actually i'm not sure how to answer",
        "that last one um i think just generally",
        "uh public ledger stuff is good um",
        "because uh",
        "i'm a fan of open source and just and",
        "just you know uh",
        "sunlight being a great disinfectant and",
        "the more the less things occur in the",
        "dark the better",
        "um",
        "and uh you know sort of a cryptic",
        "basically i mean blockchains are",
        "just a it's a cryptographic ledger um an",
        "open you know",
        "so",
        "i think that uh",
        "there's probably a lot of things good",
        "things that you've done with that",
        "i said i could neither confirm nor did i",
        "just",
        "be curious no i mean there's a lot of",
        "self-driving beta i don't know um",
        "people don't seem to listen to the md i",
        "mean i'm not sure if there's uh",
        "yeah i don't i don't know why this is in",
        "the nda we probably don't need it but",
        "people just are ignoring it anyway so",
        "i'm sure it matters",
        "that front",
        "well i've said for a long time i think",
        "ai safety is a really big deal",
        "and we should have some regulatory",
        "agency that is",
        "overseeing ai safety um",
        "but there is not yet currently any such",
        "thing and just generally any kind of",
        "regulatory agency done by the government",
        "will usually takes years to put in place",
        "so",
        "you know",
        "after",
        "the population collapse issue i think ai",
        "safety is probably the second biggest",
        "a threat to the future of civilization",
        "um",
        "and um",
        "yeah",
        "like i said i'm not quite sure what to",
        "do with it",
        "um",
        "i mean tesla",
        "is arguably the",
        "the world's biggest robot maker because",
        "like we have basically",
        "similar semi-autonomous cars that will",
        "ultimately be fully autonomous um and we",
        "are building a humanoid robot that will",
        "be",
        "basically like um like like the car but",
        "with legs",
        "so",
        "um",
        "and i kind of",
        "held off on doing that for a while",
        "because",
        "you know i i certainly don't want to",
        "hasten the ai apocalypse but clearly",
        "they look at boston dynamics and like",
        "this humanoid robots are going to happen",
        "so",
        "um",
        "they're either going to happen with or",
        "without tesla so it's like tesla i've",
        "got a little bit more i mean a lot more",
        "ability to ensure uh robotics safety and",
        "ai um",
        "and i'll try my best to to do that",
        "have not figured that out i mean it's",
        "tricky because we have the fancy doors",
        "they're awesome yeah the doors are",
        "awesome but you know if you have a roof",
        "rack like how do you stop the doors from",
        "smash you know",
        "yeah",
        "thank you and the model y has a roof",
        "the kids really",
        "want elon musk",
        "it does have a tow hitch",
        "you can tow your stuff",
        "for a full selfie that's awesome really",
        "it's like something different and it",
        "it's different and people sometimes",
        "don't like the different things but how",
        "i mean",
        "the transition period",
        "to new technology is always a little",
        "bumpy",
        "and",
        "but i think",
        "we published the",
        "the safety stats like basically miles",
        "driven",
        "on",
        "autopilot and miles driven",
        "manually and this",
        "i mean",
        "it's an order of magnitude different so",
        "like people would say oh well you're",
        "playing with the statistics i'm like",
        "listen",
        "we're just saying",
        "miles driven an autopilot mile's not",
        "driving order but there's a 10 up back",
        "to 10 difference so",
        "i mean even if we were like we're not",
        "fiddling with statistics that's just",
        "it this is not subtle it's what i'm",
        "saying it's not subtle",
        "um the truth is that people are actually",
        "not great at driving these two-ton",
        "death machines you know and people get",
        "tired",
        "and they um",
        "get drunk and they get distracted and",
        "they text and they do all sorts of",
        "things they shouldn't do",
        "and then the cars that you know crash",
        "basically um",
        "and um",
        "now that now",
        "when we're embarking on the autonomy",
        "front",
        "uh someone told me i think that's quite",
        "true which is even if you",
        "for argument's sake",
        "uh",
        "reduce",
        "fatalities by 90 percent with autonomy",
        "um",
        "the 10 that do die uh with autonomy are",
        "still going to sue you right",
        "the 90",
        "that are living don't even know that",
        "that's the reason they're alive",
        "um",
        "nonetheless um",
        "i've had many conversations with the",
        "tesla autopilot full self-driving team",
        "who are just an",
        "outstanding group of people",
        "um",
        "and saying like listen guys",
        "it is better to",
        "um",
        "like the reality of doing the right",
        "thing matters more than the perception",
        "of doing the right thing",
        "and as long as we are confident that",
        "we're doing the right thing even if we",
        "are criticized and sued and all that",
        "we should not only do the right thing",
        "and not",
        "care about simply the perception of the",
        "right thing okay last question sorry",
        "think that's a that's a very good",
        "question",
        "um the full answer is is lengthy um i'll",
        "try to give this the short version",
        "um",
        "the electricity demand",
        "roughly if if if we go if we if we shift",
        "um or transport to electric um",
        "then electricity demand approximately",
        "doubles maybe a little more than doubles",
        "um",
        "and this is going to create a lot of",
        "challenges with the the grid",
        "especially for uh distribution to",
        "neighborhoods",
        "and this is why tesla has the product",
        "the solar roof and solar retrofit",
        "is because even if you increase",
        "sustainable power generation at the",
        "utility level you're still going to have",
        "a distribution problem where you need",
        "new high power lines near medium power",
        "lines you need to dramatically increase",
        "the size of the substations which means",
        "you're going to have to start knocking",
        "down houses to increase the substation",
        "size this is really",
        "unworkable unless you have uh",
        "significant local power generation at",
        "houses and this is why i think it's",
        "actually very important that um",
        "that a a necessary part of the solution",
        "is local power generation",
        "on",
        "on",
        "rooms on the houses of homes",
        "very important",
        "and then of course we need",
        "large",
        "sustainable power generation",
        "developments",
        "primarily wind and solar",
        "but needs to be paired with battery",
        "packs will steady state so you can",
        "provide continuous power",
        "and a lot of good things are happening",
        "in this regard the growth of solar in",
        "the last several years has been",
        "incredible i think it's like a forty",
        "percent",
        "um compound annual growth rate in in",
        "solar",
        "and uh also a big growth in wind",
        "i'm also kind of a pro nuclear",
        "pro-nuclear",
        "nuclear nuclear for nuclear",
        "and um you know i'm sort of surprised by",

        "nuclear um",
        "and",
        "i'm not saying we should go build a",

        "don't think we should shut down ones",
        "that are operating safely um",
        "and um",
        "but they did that they did this in",
        "germany for example i think that was and",

        "and i don't think that was uh",
        "the",
        "right decision frankly so",

        "um",

        "more electricity generation",
